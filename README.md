# Yomitan Pop-up Dictionary for Japanese Proper Nouns

Welcome to the Yomitan Pop-up Dictionary! This dictionary is focused on Japanese proper nouns. It was put together by scraping the Japanese Wikipedia to bring you the ~10,000 most commonly used proper nouns.

The dictionary is based on an Anki deck originally created by an anon who pulled all these proper nouns from Wikipedia. You can check out the original deck [here on AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/3885156604).
